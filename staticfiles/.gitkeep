# Staticfiles Directory

This directory is used by Django's `collectstatic` command to gather all static files from apps and other locations into a single location for serving in production.

## Purpose

- Contains collected static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts)
- Served by Nginx in production
- Generated by `python manage.py collectstatic`

## Usage

```bash
# Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

**Note:** This directory is excluded from Git (except this .gitkeep file) as static files are collected during deployment.
