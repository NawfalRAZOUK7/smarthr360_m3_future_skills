# Documentation Archive

This directory contains archived documentation that is no longer actively maintained but kept for historical reference.

## Purpose

- **Historical Reference**: Documentation from previous development phases
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete project history
- **Knowledge Base**: Reference for understanding past decisions and implementations

## Organization

Move outdated or superseded documentation here to keep the main docs/ directory clean and focused on current, active documentation.

## Guidelines

### When to Archive

Archive documentation when:

- Feature documentation is superseded by newer versions
- Project phases are completed and documented in summary files
- Documentation is no longer relevant to current development but valuable for history

### What to Keep Active

Keep in main docs/ directory:

- Current API documentation
- Active architecture documentation
- Current deployment guides
- User guides and admin guides
- Up-to-date development guides

### Archive Naming Convention

When archiving, consider adding date prefix:

- `YYYY-MM-DD_original_filename.md`
- Example: `2025-11-28_old_deployment_guide.md`
